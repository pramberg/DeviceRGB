# 🌈 DeviceRGB  - UE4 Plugin
**Functional, but still a work in progress. No releases yet, so you have to use a C++ project to build yourself**

This plugin aims to make it easy to add effects to devices from various manufacturers using materials in Unreal. It has a layer system with support for masking layers to certain devices. Per key masking is supported, but experimental.
